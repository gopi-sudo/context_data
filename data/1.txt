A: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to have a relatively simple syntax.

Q: What are the benefits of using Python?
A: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. It is also known for its ease of use and readability.

Q: How can you comment out a line of code in Python?
A: You can comment out a line of code in Python by adding a "#" symbol before the line. This tells the interpreter to ignore that line of code.

Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
A: A list is a mutable sequence of elements, while a tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. This means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list, but not in a tuple.

Q: How do you import a module in Python?
A: You can import a module in Python using the "import" statement. For example, to import the "math" module, you would use the following code: "import math".

Q: What is the difference between "range" and "xrange" in Python?
A: In Python 2, "range" creates a list of values, while "xrange" creates an iterator. This means that "xrange" is more memory-efficient when dealing with large ranges.

Q: What is a lambda function in Python?
A: A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are often used as shortcuts for simple functions.

Q: How can you handle errors in Python?
A: You can handle errors in Python using "try" and "except" statements. This allows you to catch and handle exceptions that might otherwise cause your program to crash.

Q: What is a decorator in Python?
A: A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a modified version of that function. Decorators are often used to add additional functionality to existing functions.

Q: What is a generator in Python?
A: A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to generate values on the fly, rather than storing them in memory. This can be useful when dealing with large data sets.
